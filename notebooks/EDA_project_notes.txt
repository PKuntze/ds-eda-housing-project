EDA - brief look into data:

* missing data:
    - waterfront        ~ 12%    not important
    - year renovated    ~ 19%    likely important vor selling
    - ft^2 of basement  ~  2%    may be important for buying
    - view              < 10     not important
    - no correlation between missing values

* more sales_ids than house_ids => some houses were sold multiple times

* categorial columns:
	- waterfront
	- view
	- condition
	- grade
	- Zipcode?!

* Research Questions:
	1. What is the best timing strategy when selling multiple central houses over time to get best prices?
	2. What costs can be expected for houses that suit the client best?

* Hypotheses
	1.1 House prices differ from month to month.
		-> Yes, from end of November to Februar prices are generally lowest and highest from April to June.
	1.2 There is a general trend of increasing house prices in the city centre.
		-> Can’t be confirmed due to very small temporal range of data set. Internet research yielded overall 3 year stagnation at best slightly increasing trend. In city centre rather negative Trent.
	2.1 Houses further away from the centre cost less. (Geographical Hypotheses)
		-> Did not assess this because I changed strategy!
	2.2 Houses in outskirt neighborhoods with good accessibility cost more. (Geographical Hypotheses)
